# Notes
- At the moment to made the test, the API was not working well. I made a file called Meme.json (you can find it in StatesideTest -> Supporting Files -> Meme.json) that has the API call hardcoded. At the time when the app make the API call, I check if the call was succeessfully, verifing the attribute "success" that comes in the JSON, in case the success value if false, I use the .json file localed in Supporting files folder.
Any doubt, please let me know.
